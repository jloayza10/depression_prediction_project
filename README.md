# Depression Prediction

This is a machine learning project focused on analyzing and predicting the severity of depression using self-reported 1-year health data from a mental health observational study. The objective of this project is to replicate and extend the analysis performed in the research paper by Makhmutova et al. [1] and present a complete machine learning pipeline for depression prediction.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is obtained from the paper by Makhmutova et al. [1], which can be found [here](https://github.com/jloayza10/depression_prediction_project/blob/master/data/raw/makhmutova2021.pdf). It consists of self-reported health data collected over a one-year period.

## Project Steps

The following steps are performed as part of this machine learning project:

- Data Reading
- Data Cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualizations
- Feature Engineering
- Feature Selection
- Model Selection: In particular use of the xgboost model
- Hyperparameter Tuning
- Model Evaluation
- Cross-Validation
